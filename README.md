Stack Data Structures
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. 
It is similar to a stack of plates where you add a plate to the top, and when you remove a plate, you take the one on top.
Main Operations of a Stack:

    Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
    Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
    Peek(in Java)/Top(in C/c++): View the top element of the stack without removing it.
    isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
    Size: Get the number of elements in the stack
